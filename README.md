## Overview

This is my submission for my seventh Frontend Mentor project, built with vanilla HTML and CSS. For this project I followed along with this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg7Fvvl3taU&t), as well as using the git repo that was linked in the video, to better follow along and focus my learning on grid layouts. Although I didn't code everything from scratch this time, it was really interesting working with a different code structure, and understanding the perspective and way the guy approaches these problems in this tutorial.

## My process

I essentially followed along with the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg7Fvvl3taU&t). After the tutorial and finishing the project I spent some time playing around with the CSS code. Being this code was done by a professional, it was interesting to see a lot of new methods, properties, and ways of going about structuring the design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

Focusing on grid, I enjoyed learning about the usage of `grid-template-area:`. Although it took a second to wrap my head around the concept, setting up that kind of design control can be universally benefitial knowledge for most design scenarios.

### Continued development

While I generally prefer to deepen my expertise in a select few programs rather than spread myself too thin, I am eager to start working with libraries more in the future. I'm seeking web design tips that will enable me to minimize time spent on styling so I can focus more on functionality.
